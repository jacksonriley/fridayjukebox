# fridayjukebox
Repository to scrape the friday jukebox playlist and maintain a back catalogue


Once you clone the repo, you can just run the scraping script:

```
python3 fridayjukebox/scraping.py
```

That'll output a new file (or overwrite the existing one) corresponding to the current Friday Jukebox playlist
